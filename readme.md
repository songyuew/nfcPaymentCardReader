# Talk to your Credit Card part 7 (final app)

This app shows how to talk with a Credit Card and get information's like the Credit Card number, 
the card's expiration date and some other data.

The description can be found in an article series on medium.com: https://medium.com/@androidcrypto/talk-to-your-credit-card-part-7-find-and-print-out-the-application-primary-account-number-52b24b396082

- general overview about the app
- ask the card which applications are available on the card ("select PPSE")
- analyze the card's response and identify one or more of the application number or application id ("AID")
- select one application on the card to work with ("select AID") [or iterate through the applications  and run the following steps for each application]
- analyze the card's response to find out what data the card needs to proceed (find the "processing options data object list" (PDOL))
- analyze the card's response and get the content of the element "application file locator" (AFL) list
- read all files given in the AFL list and find the file where there are the elements "Application Primary Account Number" and "Application Expiration Date"
- print out the "Application Primary Account Number" ("PAN") = card number and "Application Expiration Date" = expiration date of the card.

The app uses the NFC **ReaderMode** to get access to the card.

There are apps available for each step in my GitHub repository - the naming shows the step that has the code including this step.

This is the app for the (final) seventh step 7: **find and print out the "Application Primary Account Number" ("PAN") = card number** in **TalkToYourCreditCardPart7**.

The app is tested on real Android devices running Android versions 5.0.1, 8.0 and 13.

**A compiled version of the app is available in the "debug-release" folder of this repository**: ![app-debug.apk](debug-release/app-debug.apk?raw=true)

These are the steps to read a payment card, it is a kind of "question & answer" workflow:
- ask the card which applications are available on the card ("select PPSE")
- analyze the card's response and identify one or more of the application number or application id ("AID")
- select one application on the card to work with ("select AID") [or iterate through the applications  and run the following steps for each application]
- analyze the card's response to find out what data the card needs to proceed (find the "processing options data object list" (PDOL))
- analyze the card's response and get the content of the element "application file locator" (AFL) list
- read all files given in the AFL list and find the file where there are the elements "Application Primary Account Number" and "Application Expiration Date"
- print out the "Application Primary Account Number" ("PAN") = card number and "Application Expiration Date" = expiration date of the card.

In AndroidManifest.xml grant these permissions:
```plaintext
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.NFC" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.VIBRATE" />
```

There are 3 dependencies necessary for the app to run:
